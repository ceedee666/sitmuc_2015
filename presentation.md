# Agenda
1. Why functional programming?
1. Why elixir?
1. Basic types
1. Immutability
1. Pattern matching
1. Functions
1. Recursion
1. Concurrency



# Why FP?
- Abstractions
- DSLs
- Concurrency



#Why elixir?
- Runs on the Erlang VM
  - Reuse Erlang libraries
  - Modern functional language
- Erlang VM
  - Scalable 
  - Fault-Tolerant 
  - Simplified concurrent programming 



#Basic Types
```Elixir
# There are numbers
3    # integer
3.0  # float

# Atoms, that are literals, a constant with name. They start with `:`.
:hello # atom

# Tuples that are stored contiguously in memory.
{1,2,3} # tuple

# Lists that are implemented as linked lists.
[1,2,3] # list

# Strings
"hello" # string
```


#Immutability



#Pattern matching



#Functions


##Pure functions


##Higher order functions



#Recursion
